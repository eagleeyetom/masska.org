    <p>(finishing his sentence) ...they break the pull of the earth's gravity and send their projectile through outer space. (Doc stares at her, dumbfounded, and she laughs) Emmett...I read that book too. You're quoting Jules Verne, From The Earth To The Moon. (surprised) You've read Jules Verne? I adore Jules Verne. So do I. 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, my absolute favorite. The first time I read that when I was a little boy I wanted to meet Captain Nemo and... (laughing) Please, Emmett...you couldn't have read that when you were a little boy, it was only first published ten years ago.</p>

    <p>(He goes to take a drink but spits it out when she lights a cigarette.) Jesus, you smoke too? Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. (The Dance) (George is off to the side dancing by himself.)</p>

    <p>You damned fool! (The two get out of the car.) Never, never leave this book lying around! Don't you have a safe? (realizes) No, you don't have a safe. Get a safe! Keep it locked up, and until then keep it on you like this. (He puts the book in 1955 Biff's back jeans pocket.) Hey, what're ya doing? And don't tell anyone about it either. Oh, and there's one more thing. (During the following 1955 Biff closes the garage door, and the Biffs leave the garage.) One day, a kid, or a crazy wild-eyed scientist who claims to be a scientist is gonna come around asking about that book... (They walk off, continuing their conversation. Marty tries to open the door - but it's locked! And we see the outside padlock to prove it. Marty looks up at the windows, but they're far too small for him to climb out of.) I'm trapped! (He gets his walkie-talkie out.) Doc, come in Doc!</p>

    <p>(shakes his head 'no') The Browns came to America in 1908, and then they were the Von Brauns. My father changed our name in World War I. Doc! Look! (Thumbing through photos, he has found a picture of Doc on September 5, 1885 in front of the brand new clock now in the clock tower.) Oh! Great Scott! It's me! Then it is true. All of it. It is me who goes back there...and gets shot. It's not gonna happen Doc. (Doc looks at him.) After you fix the time circuits and put new tires on the Delorean, I'm going back to 1885 and I'm bringing you home.</p>
